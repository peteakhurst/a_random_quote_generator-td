/*** 
  Create the array of quote objects and name it `quotes`.
  Add at least five quote objects to the `quotes` array.
  Give each quote object a `quote` and `source` property.
  Add the `citation` property to at least one object in the array.
  Add the `year` property to at least one object in the array.
  Use console.log() to log your array of quotes to the console.
